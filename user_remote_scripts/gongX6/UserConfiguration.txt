# Config File for User-defined Instant Mappings

# We assume that the controls on your MIDI controller
# send CCs (except for pads). All controls that do not have
# an explicit channel setting are expected to use the
# global channel. CCs & Notes are counted from 0-127
# and channels from 0-15.

[Globals]

# The channel that the controller should send on
# NOTE: this is real_channel - 1 (since the channel index starts with 0, not 1)
GlobalChannel: 7


# If your controller is connected via USB, replace ControllerName
# with the name of the respective port. Live will then try to
# recognize the ports for you when you select your Instant-Mappings
InputName: X6mini
OutputName: X6mini
